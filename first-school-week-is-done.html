School went well, though it's always crazy getting into a rythm, I think mom was pleased with how it went, definitely enjoying our day of rest.</p><p> Went to church and worshipped the Almighty God! We were invited to the Holters for lunch and met their 6 adorable puppies! Puppies worth $2,000+, they are labradoodles, all very sweet and quite adorable, luckily their teeth weren't in yet, otherwise my hands would be a sorry mess. </p><p>Mom and I are trying to convince dad to get a dog, we had one a few years back that ended in diaster (had to put her done because she bit someone) We hope to get a Mastiff, we were looking at adoption options yesterday, there are a lot of good ones, but mom doesn't think they'd consider us for adoption since we wouldn't bring them to the vet that often. </p><p>It's been pretty heated in politics this past week, especially gun control. Last week on Saturday the El Paso shooting claimed 22 lives, the youngest a 15 yr. old, just a little younger than Reuben. The Walmart was at it's full capacity between 2,000-3,000 people, police responded within 6 minutes. <a href="https://time.com/5643420/victims-el-paso-shooting/">Victims of the shooting</a></p><p>Then not more than 24 hrs later in Dayton, Ohio in which 10 people were killed (including the shooter) thankfully police responded within 30 seconds of the shooting, just before he walked in the NedPeppers bar full of people.</p><p>Fortnite WC just ended. The 16 yr. old winner got $3,000,000. Like, what a way to waste your life, but that tiny chance of winning must be a huge driving force. And people are using this to say "see, you can earn money playing games". Yes you can, but it's such a tiny chance. He was 1 in <strong>40 million</strong> players. </p><p>This <a href="https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/chennai-doctors-extract-526-teeth-from-7-year-olds-mouth">boy</a> had 526 teeth extracted from his mouth. <strong>526</strong>.                        </p><p>A 22 yr. old <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/amazon-dirt-scam-22-year-old">scammed Amazon</a> out of $370,000. Reuben showed this to me earlier, pretty crazy.                                                                </p><p>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000006624535/hong-kong-protest-police-triad-investigation.html">This</a> has graphic images in it that show the aftermath of the attack on the subway in Hong Kong, please don't watch it if you're not prepared.
