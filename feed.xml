                <p> I've always wanted to have our rabbits permanently inside (we have them in a dog kennel on our porch atm) but Icey poops and sprays everywhere, and we've had problems with Mocha spraying the couch cushions before she had her 3 litters. So I talked to dad, my plan is that we would drop them off at a clinic an hr. and half away which charges $80 to have them spayed (around here it's 400$) stay at a coffee shop while the surgery happens, they recover and then head home. This is the clinic that offers it at such a good price - <a href="http://sheetspetclinic.com/low-cost-spay-neuter/price-list.html">Sheetspetclinic</a></p>
<p>I have two really good Ancient Antiquity books, one is 'From Barbarians to Angels' probably my favorite out of the two, and 'Fall of an Empire and Atilla the Hun'. </p>
<p> Pewdiepie (on the 20th) and Dwayne Johnson each (18th) got married one day apart, I was super surprised about Pewdiepie's marriage (we'll see how long it lasts...) it was out of the blue.</p>

<p>Spider man is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/business/media/sony-spiderman-mcu.html">leaving</a> the MCU ! Fans are definitely not happy, though maybe this is good, seeing the path Marvel is starting to trod down (i.e.<a href="https://twitter.com/_RyanGajewski/status/1152759907923320832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1152759907923320832&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinknews.co.uk%2F2019%2F07%2F21%2Fvalkyrie-mcu-first-official-lgbtq-superhero-sdcc%2F"> lesbian Valkyrie</a>, and female Thor)</p>
<p>From this <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/07/holocaust-survivor-celebrates-104th-birthday-surrounded-by-400-descendants/?utm_source=twitter_sitebuttons&amp;utm_medium=site%20buttons&amp;utm_campaign=site%20buttons">lady</a> who survived the Holocaust 400+ descendants, it just helps you grasp how many future generations the Nazis destroyed. Anway all her descendants gathered around the 104 yr. old woman, very special!</p>
<p>A chunk of Mormon scriptures is based off this <a href="https://coldcasechristianity.com/writings/how-the-book-of-abraham-exposes-the-false-nature-of-mormonism/">papyrus scroll</a> that Joseph Smith "translated". The original script was thought to have been lost in the Great Chicago fire, but was found in 1966 and subsequently translated, and not as the Mormons were hoping - proven false. </p>
<p> It's pretty crazy in <em><a title="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/world/asia/kashmir-crackdown-newspapers.html" class="anchor-3Z-8Bb anchorUnderlineOnHover-2ESHQB" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/world/asia/kashmir-crackdown-newspapers.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" role="button" tabindex="0">Kashmir</a></em> right now (bewarned this has a few images of people that were hit by shotgun pellets multiple times) but reporters still brave the streets trying to keep the population informed. Seizing Kashmir was definitely a risky move for India, and inflamed their tedious relationship with Pakistan.</p>
<p>Can you <a href="https://twitter.com/TowerOfLondon/status/1161898503636967425">escape</a> the Tower of London?! The Tower of London's twitter account put together a fun little game. </p>

<p>What worldly thing could be better than a <a href="https://twitter.com/Pandamoanimum/status/1164834588696272897">millipede walking to Aerosmith ft. Run DMC</a>? I truly don't know </p>
<p>Good contrast video, it helps to grasp what a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ektNpslOUPM">huge horrible impact</a> abortion has made on this country.</p>
<p> San Francisco has new guidlines on how to address ex-felons. And to be honest they literally make no sense - "a 'convicted felon or an offender released from custody' must now be known as a 'formerly incarcerated person' or a 'justice-invovled person' or simply a 'returning resident'. Likewise, repeat offenders will be called 'addicts.' But, actual drug addicts must now be called 'a person with a history of substance use.' Minor juvenile delinquents will be called a 'young person impacted by the juvenile justice system' or a 'young person with justice system involvement.'" -</p>
<p>Oh my, it takes work to keep a house going! Apparently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-08-26/gender-equality-in-the-boardroom-starts-in-the-laundry-room">Bloomberg</a> thinks that this shouldn't be <img class="emoji jumboable" draggable="false" src="https://discordapp.com/assets/53ef346458017da2062aca5c7955946b.svg" alt=":thinking:" width="31" height="31"></p>
<p>A new <a href="https://twitter.com/Jonandstuff/status/1132015351862943744">gallery display</a> at the YBCA Public Square, San Francisco Calif. is named "Why Don't We Murder More White People?" It's really weird.</p>
<p>Mark Rober's new video is really good! He and his friend Bob Pflugfelder broke the world record (placed by Bob the year before) for the biggest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kou7ur5xt_4">Elephant Toothpaste reaction</a> by filling up a swimming pool with it! Very good watch!</p>

                <p>So busy last weekend (maybe just lazy) I never did my blog post! School went well, though it's always crazy getting into a rythm, I think mom was pleased with how it went, definitely enjoying our day of rest.</p>
<p> Went to church and worshipped the Almighty God! We were invited to the Holters for lunch and met their 6 adorable puppies! Puppies worth $2,000+, they are labradoodles, all very sweet and quite adorable, luckily their teeth weren't in yet, otherwise my hands would be a sorry mess. </p>
<p>Mom and I are trying to convince dad to get a dog, we had one a few years back that ended in diaster (had to put her done because she bit someone) We hope to get a Mastiff, we were looking at adoption options yesterday, there are a lot of good ones, but mom doesn't think they'd consider us for adoption since we wouldn't bring them to the vet that often. </p>
<p>It's been pretty heated in politics this past week, especially gun control. Last week on Saturday the El Paso shooting claimed 22 lives, the youngest a 15 yr. old, just a little younger than Reuben. The Walmart was at it's full capacity between 2,000-3,000 people, police responded within 6 minutes. <a href="https://time.com/5643420/victims-el-paso-shooting/">Victims of the shooting</a></p>
<p>Then not more than 24 hrs later in Dayton, Ohio in which 10 people were killed (including the shooter) thankfully police responded within 30 seconds of the shooting, just before he walked in the NedPeppers bar full of people.</p>
<p>Fortnite WC just ended. The 16 yr. old winner got $3,000,000. Like, what a way to waste your life, but that tiny chance of winning must be a huge driving force. And people are using this to say "see, you can earn money playing games". Yes you can, but it's such a tiny chance. He was 1 in <strong>40 million</strong> players. </p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/chennai-doctors-extract-526-teeth-from-7-year-olds-mouth">boy</a> had 526 teeth extracted from his mouth. <strong>526</strong>.                        </p>
<p>A 22 yr. old <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/retail/amazon-dirt-scam-22-year-old">scammed Amazon</a> out of $370,000. Reuben showed this to me earlier, pretty crazy.                                                                </p>
<p>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000006624535/hong-kong-protest-police-triad-investigation.html">This</a> has graphic images in it that show the aftermath of the attack on the subway in Hong Kong, please don't watch it if you're not prepared. But it shows clearly why Hong Kongers are getting fed up with authorities, and an overview of what happened last week.</p>

<p>We had multiple families over Friday for our summer open house, in which we allow anybody on Friday from 1-4 to drop by. </p>
<p>Went and watched Emma today with some friends (Lily Baker, Angelina Rizzo, and Faith Rezentes) I'm not going to be participating in the book club until I can drive, as it's too much hassle for mom and dad to drive. Especially since I have a bad habit of not keeping track of the time, and being late.</p>
<p>If I register for Driver's Ed now, and turn 15 on February I should be able to drive in 1 1/2 yrs, it's crazy! I can't wait until February when Reuben can drive by himself, we want to go down to Raleigh for Crav Maga lessons.</p>
<p>Birthday month is closing in on us, Kit's is on the 6th, Katherine's on the 9th, and Tilly's on the 19th(?). Elaine will be making Kit, Cookie Monster cupcakes! I'll be doing Katherine's, I'd like to do something like this - We'll probably do tea party style, maybe invite Penny and Evelyn over.<img src="https://amerciless.github.io/blog/media/posts/5/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-2.55.22-PM.png" alt="" width="592" height="678"></p>

Paine). To be an astronaut would be a dream come true, to learn team skills, to be a scientist, and an engineer, how to speak Russian and so much more. I've seen astronauts say, leaving family behind is the hardest part of it all, knowing that maybe, maybe it could fail, even with the meticulous preparation, it's a serious career you have to be dedicated to. If your on Twitter I suggest giving a follow to <a href="https://twitter.com/Space_Station">https://twitter.com/Space_Station</a>, you get a mix of everything.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/destinws2">SmarterEveryDay</a> is one of my favorite Youtubers, I suggest you check out his channel! His one about grain bins was really good.</p>
<p>Also Mike Rowe has a really good show called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ReturningTheFavor/">Returning the Favor</a>, free on Facebook, all of the family enjoys it!</p>
<p>One game I'm really enjoying, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289070/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VI/">Sid Meier's Civilization VI</a>. Usually it's CRAZY expensive, but it's 70% off right now making it doable. It's the most detailed game I've had a chance to play, it took a while but I'm finally starting to get the hang of it. I really enjoy picking the World Map as a random civilization, and you get placed wherever that civilization orginally started in real life.</p>
<p>A very simple total Civ VI <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pczrASkYGSo">beginners tutorial</a> that helped me alot, they guy is engaging and keeps your attention the whole time, a very good teacher.</p>
<p>Just rewatched Big Hero 6 with my siblings. Such a good animated movie, it makes us break into laughter every time we watch it. I hope the sequel is just as good! Big Hero 7 will be released November 6th 2020</p>

<p>I came across a very interesting subject (i.e. weird and unnecessary) in the Reading Comprehension part of my CAT test here's one of them<img src="https://amerciless.github.io/blog/media/posts/2/Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-12.14.09-PM.png" alt="" width="1570" height="966"> I asked a few online friends (not homeschoolers) and they had no idea what it was, like I said, weird. My final score was decent, thogh I do wish I could backtrack and see what I got wrong in the end. On average I got 87% right.<img src="https://amerciless.github.io/blog/media/posts/2/Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-12.20.37-PM.png" alt="" width="1644" height="726"></p>
<p> I'm starting to enjoy Seid Meier's Civilization VI, but it's taken a while, and I still feel intimidated by it sometimes, I found a really good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pczrASkYGSo">tutorial series</a> by the youtuber quill18, he keeps you attention captivated and is good at explaining all the many details. Be willing to dedicate you time though, there are six parts that are each about 30 min long.</p>

<p>Had a good conversation with a Catholic and ex-Catholic (no longer "religious") it's my first conversation involving religion directly that I've had on Discord, and with a Catholic in general. It started from a very... uh... interesting source. </p>
<p>This is the only "major" Discord server I participate in (200 members, 20 active) many of them are friends friends, a decent amount of them met Calvin Dunn when he participated in Classical Conversation groups, so the majority of them are christian (to what extent I don't know) It was nice being able to pull up scripture in a conversation, I love how some adults can go right to the Bible on different subjects right away. I hope that I'll be able to do that more and more often as I study and read the Bible.</p>

<p>Interesting things I learned this week:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/explorations/ex1903/logs/july4/july4.html">Ravoli starfish?!</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair_tennis">Wheelchair tennis</a>, and at Wimbledon!</p>
<p>This <a href="https://apnews.com/c30431b28e944bf1b7994cf1c261a562?utm_medium=APWestRegion&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow">driver</a> has some serious luck, I literally started sweating when I saw this.</p>
<p>Hurrican Barry has weakened <a href="https://world.wng.org/content/barry_on_slow_wet_slog_into_louisiana">from hurricane</a> to tropical storm upon landfall! Sounds like it's not going to be as bad as first thought.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/area-51/storm-area-51-they-cant-stop-all-of-us/448435052621047/">Storm Area 51</a>, such a good idea! If you want a prime example of people being stupid, here ya go! I wonder if some people will actually show up. I have to say, the memes that are coming from this are almost worth it. Let the meme storm begin! <em>evil laugh</em></p>

<p class="XzvDs _208Ie _2Dym_ blog-post-text-font blog-post-text-color _2p1aK _2R0Lu _2Dym_">I've lived in North Carolina my whole life, my mom is from Oregon, and my dad was born in Texas but moved when he was nine to NC. Oh and another thing I should mention is that I have 7 totally berserk (aka awesome) siblings running wild in the house! I wish I could have more siblings, but Dad is now counting on us for the next generation of Talbotts. My dad is a succesful entrepreneur, and one of the co-founders of <a href="https://www.spreedly.com/" target="_top" class="_2qJYG blog-link-hashtag-color _3sz0l">Spreedly</a> and was the CTO for quite a while.

<div class="XzvDs _208Ie _2Dym_ blog-post-text-font blog-post-text-color _2p1aK _2R0Lu _2Dym_">One of my favorite psalms is Psalm 139:</div>
<p class="XzvDs _208Ie _2Dym_ blog-post-text-font blog-post-text-color _2p1aK _2R0Lu _2Dym_">"Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence? <strong>8 </strong>If I ascend into heaven, You <em>are</em> there; If I make my bed in [<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+139&amp;version=NKJV#fen-NKJV-16248c" target="_top" class="_2qJYG blog-link-hashtag-color _3sz0l">c</a>]hell, behold, You <em>are there.</em> <strong>9 </strong><em>If</em> I take the wings of the morning, <em>And</em> dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, <strong>10 </strong>Even there Your hand shall lead me, And Your right hand shall hold me. <strong>11 </strong>If I say, “Surely the darkness shall [<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+139&amp;version=NKJV#fen-NKJV-16251d" target="_top" class="_2qJYG blog-link-hashtag-color _3sz0l">d</a>]fall on me,” Even the night shall be light about me; <strong>12 </strong>Indeed, the darkness shall not hide from You, But the night shines as the day; The darkness and the light <em>are</em> both alike <em>to You.</em></p>
<p class="XzvDs _208Ie _2Dym_ blog-post-text-font blog-post-text-color _2p1aK _2R0Lu _2Dym_"><strong>13 </strong>For You formed my inward parts; You [<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+139&amp;version=NKJV#fen-NKJV-16253f" target="_top" class="_2qJYG blog-link-hashtag-color _3sz0l">f</a>]covered me in my mother’s womb. <strong>14 </strong>I will praise You, for [<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+139&amp;version=NKJV#fen-NKJV-16254g" target="_top" class="_2qJYG blog-link-hashtag-color _3sz0l">g</a>]I am fearfully <em>and</em> wonderfully made; Marvelous are Your works, And <em>that</em> my soul knows very well. <strong>15 </strong>My [<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+139&amp;version=NKJV#fen-NKJV-16255h" target="_top" class="_2qJYG blog-link-hashtag-color _3sz0l">h</a>]frame was not hidden from You, When I was made in secret, <em>And</em> skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. <strong>16 </strong>Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. And in Your book they all were written, The days fashioned for me, When <em>as yet there were</em> none of them."</p>
<div class="XzvDs _208Ie _2Dym_ blog-post-text-font blog-post-text-color _2p1aK _2R0Lu _2Dym_"> </div>
<p class="XzvDs _208Ie _2Dym_ blog-post-text-font blog-post-text-color _2p1aK _2R0Lu _2Dym_">I am pro-life, any Christian who claims that a baby in the womb can be sacrificed (murdered) for the mother's "success" (in the end, being judged by the Almighty LORD I doubt it will be seen as success, but murder) is a bible denier as seen in the psalm above. And as we learn more about the baby in the womb it seems like they will soon be science-deniers.</p>
