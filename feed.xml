                <p>It's been a slow good week. Next week we begin school, mom has been working hard the past few weeks preparing and editing the curriculum she gets from <a href="https://charlottemasoninstitute.org/alveary-membership/">Charlotte Mason's Alveary</a>.</p>
<p>We had multiple families over Friday for our summer open house, in which we allow anybody on Friday from 1-4 to drop by. </p>
<p>Went and watched Emma today with some friends (Lily Baker, Angelina Rizzo, and Faith Rezentes) I'm not going to be participating in the book club until I can drive, as it's too much hassle for mom and dad to drive. Especially since I have a bad habit of not keeping track of the time, and being late.</p>
<p>If I register for Driver's Ed now, and turn 15 on February I should be able to drive in 1 1/2 yrs, it's crazy! I can't wait until February when Reuben can drive by himself, we want to go down to Raleigh for Crav Maga lessons.</p>
<p>Birthday month is closing in on us, Kit's is on the 6th, Katherine's on the 9th, and Tilly's on the 19th(?). Elaine will be making Kit, Cookie Monster cupcakes! I'll be doing Katherine's, I'd like to do something like this - We'll probably do tea party style, maybe invite Penny and Evelyn over.<img src="https://amerciless.github.io/blog/media/posts/5/Screen-Shot-2019-07-11-at-2.55.22-PM.png" alt="" width="592" height="678"></p>

<p>Beautiful, Sujata Setia goes around taking engagement style <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/older-couple-engagement-photos_l_5d3736a9e4b020cd994a5aba?ncid=other_twitter_cooo9wqtham&amp;utm_campaign=share_twitter">photos </a>of old couples! She also has some amazing photos of grandchildren with their grandparents.</p>
<p>A handy dandy <a href="https://lmgtfy.com/?q=What%27+is+lmgtfy&amp;iie=1">internet too</a>l for when people ask "what's such and such" when they could just look it up. It's been pulled on me a few times! I put in an example. I recommend clicking the check box for "Include internet explainer" the end result is very satisfying!</p>
<p>Mark Rober's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugRc5jx80yg">new video</a> is out! Debunking the myth that sharks can smell a drop of blood (or at least some kinds). Also, he answered me on Twitter *faints*.</p>

                <p>Yesterday we commorated the 50th anniversary of man setting foot on the moon! The Soyuz MS-13 rocket launched yesterday, adding 3 more astronauts to the space station. What a special today to be blasted into space!<img src="https://amerciless.github.io/blog/media/posts/4/Screen-Shot-2019-07-21-at-3.33.29-PM.png" alt="" width="1226" height="502"></p>
<p>Also ^^^^ I did not know this, AMAZING! Buzz Aldrin is now my new hero :-) It wasn't recorded live because NASA was afraid of another lawsuit akin to when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apollo_8_Genesis_Reading.webm">Genesis was read</a> on Apollo 8th (O'Haire v. Paine). To be an astronaut would be a dream come true, to learn team skills, to be a scientist, and an engineer, how to speak Russian and so much more. I've seen astronauts say, leaving family behind is the hardest part of it all, knowing that maybe, maybe it could fail, even with the meticulous preparation, it's a serious career you have to be dedicated to. If your on Twitter I suggest giving a follow to <a href="https://twitter.com/Space_Station">https://twitter.com/Space_Station</a>, you get a mix of everything.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/destinws2">SmarterEveryDay</a> is one of my favorite Youtubers, I suggest you check out his channel! His one about grain bins was really good.</p>
<p>Also Mike Rowe has a really good show called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ReturningTheFavor/">Returning the Favor</a>, free on Facebook, all of the family enjoys it!</p>
<p>One game I'm really enjoying, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289070/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VI/">Sid Meier's Civilization VI</a>. Usually it's CRAZY expensive, but it's 70% off right now making it doable. It's the most detailed game I've had a chance to play, it took a while but I'm finally starting to get the hang of it. I really enjoy picking the World Map as a random civilization, and you get placed wherever that civilization orginally started in real life.</p>
<p>A very simple total Civ VI <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pczrASkYGSo">beginners tutorial</a> that helped me alot, they guy is engaging and keeps your attention the whole time, a very good teacher.</p>
<p>Just rewatched Big Hero 6 with my siblings. Such a good animated movie, it makes us break into laughter every time we watch it. I hope the sequel is just as good! Big Hero 7 will be released November 6th 2020</p>

My final score was decent, thogh I do wish I could backtrack and see what I got wrong in the end. On average I got 87% right.<img src="https://amerciless.github.io/blog/media/posts/2/Screen-Shot-2019-07-12-at-12.20.37-PM.png" alt="" width="1644" height="726"></p>
<p> I'm starting to enjoy Seid Meier's Civilization VI, but it's taken a while, and I still feel intimidated by it sometimes, I found a really good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pczrASkYGSo">tutorial series</a> by the youtuber quill18, he keeps you attention captivated and is good at explaining all the many details. Be willing to dedicate you time though, there are six parts that are each about 30 min long.</p>
<p><img src="https://amerciless.github.io/blog/media/posts/2/download-5.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="169"></p>
<p>Had a good conversation with a Catholic and ex-Catholic (no longer "religious") it's my first conversation involving religion directly that I've had on Discord, and with a Catholic in general. It started from a very... uh... interesting source. </p>
<p>This is the only "major" Discord server I participate in (200 members, 20 active) many of them are friends friends, a decent amount of them met Calvin Dunn when he participated in Classical Conversation groups, so the majority of them are christian (to what extent I don't know) It was nice being able to pull up scripture in a conversation, I love how some adults can go right to the Bible on different subjects right away. I hope that I'll be able to do that more and more often as I study and read the Bible.</p>

<p>Interesting things I learned this week:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/explorations/ex1903/logs/july4/july4.html">Ravoli starfish?!</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair_tennis">Wheelchair tennis</a>, and at Wimbledon!</p>
<p>This <a href="https://apnews.com/c30431b28e944bf1b7994cf1c261a562?utm_medium=APWestRegion&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow">driver</a> has some serious luck, I literally started sweating when I saw this.</p>
<p>Hurrican Barry has weakened <a href="https://world.wng.org/content/barry_on_slow_wet_slog_into_louisiana">from hurricane</a> to tropical storm upon landfall! Sounds like it's not going to be as bad as first thought.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/area-51/storm-area-51-they-cant-stop-all-of-us/448435052621047/">Storm Area 51</a>, such a good idea! If you want a prime example of people being stupid, here ya go! I wonder if some people will actually show up. I have to say, the memes that are coming from this are almost worth it. Let the meme storm begin! <em>evil laugh</em></p>

<p class="XzvDs _208Ie _2Dym_ blog-post-text-font blog-post-text-color _2p1aK _2R0Lu _2Dym_">I am pro-life, any Christian who claims that a baby in the womb can be sacrificed (murdered) for the mother's "success" (in the end, being judged by the Almighty LORD I doubt it will be seen as success, but murder) is a bible denier as seen in the psalm above. And as we learn more about the baby in the womb it seems like they will soon be science-deniers.</p>
