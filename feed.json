If you truly are sorry, I know, I can speak for myself, I forgive you, and I know that if you go to God and ask him he will forgive you. And I don't think anyone could say it, again, I'm speaking for myself, but I love you just like anyone else, and I'm not going to say I hope you rot and die just like my brother did, I personally want the best for you and I wasn't ever going to say this in front of my family and everyone, I don't even want you to go to jail. I want the best for you, because I know, I know that's exactly what Botham would want you to do and the best would be, to give your life to Christ. That's... I'm not going to say anything else, I think giving your life to Christ would be the best thing Botham would want you to do. Again I love you as a person, and I don't wish anything bad on you.

Last week on Saturday the El Paso shooting claimed 22 lives, the youngest a 15 yr. old, just a little younger than Reuben.

The 16 yr. old winner got $3,000,000. Like, what a way to waste your life, but that tiny chance of winning must be a huge driving force.
